War FTP Daemon TODO

Tasks:
===========================================================
 - Document config file settings

 ~ Implement db layer so that the FTP server can start, loading objects from the db.

 - Add unit test framework as git submodule

 - Create functional tests

 - Decide upon UI technology [QT, AngularJS, others??]

 - Set up feature specs and road-map for alpha, beta and initial release

 - [wfde] Implement virtual hosts trough TLS hostnames (Require a new, layered
    IO model, where we can add HTTP (tls, chunked, plain, gzip) and FTP (tls)
    features for re-use. Tls must be implemented manually (in stead of relying
    on asio/openssl) - but this allows us to use gnu tls, Windows encryption,
    libressl or whatever we want).

 - [warlib] Channel logging  of warnings and errors to the console when the
    log is unconfigured.
